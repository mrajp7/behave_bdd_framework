A 'Scenario' can have multiple inputs provided to its steps.
The inputs are provided as table with 'Examples' keyword.

First line is considered as heading

And one scenario can have multiple examples keyword attached to it.

Scnario Outline: <Name>
    Given .. <input1>
    When .. <input2>
    Then .. <outcome>

 Examples: <Category1>
    | input1    | input2    | outcome   |
    | X         | Y         | Yes       |   
    | I         | J         | No        |

 Examples: <Category2>
    | input1    | input2    | outcome   |
    | 1         | 2         | Yes       |   
    | 4.0       | 5.        | No        |


Note: these input can be recognised in the step definition by introducing "Step Paramters"

Step Paramters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Provides a simple parser that replaces regular expressions for step parameters with a readable syntax like {param:Type}. 
The syntax is inspired by the Python builtin string.format()
The named fields are extracted, then used as step function arguments.
